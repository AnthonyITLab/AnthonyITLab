# 👋 Hey there, I'm Anthony

Welcome to my GitHub!

## 🛠️ Who I Am
I'm a hands-on tech enthusiast with a background in manufacturing and a growing passion for IT, infrastructure, and home-based systems. I enjoy learning by building — and everything I post here reflects that.

## 💻 What I’ve Done
-  Designed, built, and maintained a **crypto mining rig** (3 systems, 16 GPUs)
-  Integrated a local network with an **Ethernet switch** and centralized router
-  Managed **GPU thermals**, BIOS tuning, power balancing, and system uptime
-  Built multiple **custom PCs** for gaming and performance
-  Completed a full **homelab setup**, including a dedicated server for storage and media

## What This GitHub is About
I use this space to document and share personal tech projects I’ve completed — from servers and networking to hardware builds and future tools I explore.

More builds and projects will be added as I keep learning and tinkering. Stay tuned!

## 🔍 Interests
- IT infrastructure & homelabs
- Self-hosted services & network setups
- Crypto tech and decentralized systems
- Real-world learning through hardware and system integration
